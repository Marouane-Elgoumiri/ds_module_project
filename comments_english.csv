Very little concentration in the second half. The renaissance of a volcano could not waste the title until the Zamalek fans were shocked by the decline in the level of Zamalek and the brilliance of the renaissance of a volcano in the second half.
"The volcanic renaissance was better in the first leg, especially in the first half, it could have won three or a quadruple had it not been for the sake of opportunities. As for the return match, the Renaissance was almost absent and increased the director, the referee, and the mouse room, not to return the shot that could have been givenPenalty."

"A final organization of the Federation Cup value, in addition to the television output that was suspicious, makes African football far from professionalism. Note: The goal base must be canceled outside the field as did the European Union."
Game Over.And benefit from errors.
"The barbarism of the Egyptians is known for a long time, when they reach the final, they want to win it by all the thugs from the players, organized directors until they say they are champions, if the Egyptian teams and the Egyptian team in Europe will not win or by the title of all their matches, they will play the lack of number"
"Zamalek crowned the title and the orange team crowned the Kaf Badana for Zamalek, we say it frankly a volcano was not at the level required to win the title. She played with great reservations and missed the ferocity even though it did not have what it lost.In which"
"Praise be to God.There is the right, and even the ruling lost Lina, a clear penalty, such as daytime"
"CAF condemns the academic events on the floor of Zamalek, hahahaha Hadi Hadi"
"We say it with every sporting spirit that the Egyptian team did not realize the interview and we saw one team on the field of the field. As for the unethical actions that we saw in the field and non -sports, I think that the volcanic team causes the mosquito and I hope a successful presence of the volcano team and it is enough for him to play with the full map for Morocco"
"Most of the Kef reports condemn the chaos and issue penalties and reprimand players, teams and universities, and ... from immoral acts for the ball.And a little we hear such communications in other continents, does this mean that all of Africa are barbaric in all fields?I think that justifies the extent to which the major countries are permissible for the field of our continent."
"Changing the method used in the finals such as this should be considered.It is better to take place in the final interview in one interview and in another neutral country because African football is still suffering from backwardness, so you see them criticizing Mr. Fawzi Qaja, who is fighting to purify the CAF from the two authorities and cut off the road for those who love chaos in order to win in various ways."
And the eastern neighbor is still waiting for the decision of the bowl and the cancellation of all the results and the beginning of zero ... as it was stated by the experts in relation to Boukhrouba ...
"Morocco has become very large on Africa, for sure we will find many difficulties with some countries that do not aspire to develop.Morocco must be good at dealing with these countries, including those who are in the vicinity"

"The Karagla are me, they gave the cup to the issue, for me to raise it, Latta, or the Match between the Krogoli donkey, Aghiz Ould Aghour with Zamalek, in October 2025,"
"This is what I said before in the first final in a volcano, I said that the goal that Zamalek scored in a volcano and reduced the result even if he was defeated by two goals for one.Zamalek Square cannot produce victorious there, as we saw, they scored the goal early and defended the mentality and strength, and they turned the result to win and the words ended, whether there is a clear penalty for a volcano or not that does not matter and did not talk about it yet."
"We have become crying and complained like us, just like Hookayla, I know why we won, the latter. Algeria, Egypt, and even Tunisia laughs at us"
"I did not understand the law of the law to calculate two points for the goal scored in the opponent's stadium that is still in force in Africa, I was the European Championship that I adopted in an interview with Beculununa against Paris Saint -Germain because I did not watch the last match, so a friend told me that they did not depend on him and indeed what happened in the Real Madrid match and did not count the goal with two points.That is why Al -Kef, in turn, must put an end to this trick or scoring fraud, where a team scored two goals after the suffering of his hardship and the opponent sneakes with a goal, then two points are counted for him and become equal without trouble, at least if the CAF cannot cancel this unfair law, it must determine a neutral stadium for the procedureThe final with one match without return or going, and whoever scores a goal for him and at the same time they will avoid any favoritism in directing and arbitration, the riots of the masses and the attack on the sporting teams of the opponents."

"Haremat has a personal problem and a dispute with Walid since the latter was coach in the national championship.Therefore, he will never play with the national team as long as Walid is the national voter."
"Whoever watched the match from the first and the way he played the volcanic renaissance can ask many questions and that the match was settled for the Zamalek team, that is, give me you!And if he would lose, but the cuff will overcome his favor without entering into the corresponding rationale, it was settled ..."
Zamalek deserves the cup by defrauding and losing time and serving.
"The renaissance of Berkane was not at the required level, which was lacking in efficiency, combat, and focus, so the coach was suspended by his failure and the failure of the players in achieving the victory over the referee.If they scored a real goal, will the ruling on its cancellation, of course, will not.So it is not necessary to look back but rather to the future."
"Zamalek, although it is not that strong team deserves the title because the volcano team is very weak. There are no chances of registration, no enthusiasm, and nothing."
Zamalek does not deserve the cup that he did not play football. Playing the players in terms of wasting time and dispersing the balls right and north.
"I am in your health, the arbitration is the last thing we can discuss. To the forum."
Do not be afraid.
"The interview must always be completed in the home and expect everything to go, as Moroccan clubs always throughout history suffer from the arbitration bias in the finals"
"Zamalek in the second half was very weak, and had it not been for the focus of volcano players, we would have won them 1-3, but unfortunately, volcano players were not at the level."
"It is obligatory for the coach of Zamalek to first thank the rule of the interview and the director of the television interview because they were the ones who gave the victory to Zamalek because the referee saw a penalty kick and overlooked it and the exit of the interview did not provide the footage to the mouse or the viewers and did not return the shot that clarified a clear penalty and also did not repeat the mistakes that were committed in the rightThe volcano players and only restore the cats committed to the players of Zamalek, and this is not the professionalism of directing, but its randomness, as the ruling was biased towards Zamalek, especially in committing mistakes, and there is a red paper that I did not give to the Zamalek player when he was stripped of their challenges on the leg of a volcano player."
"Peace be upon you. I did not want to comment on the match and behind the scenes. Frankly, we Moroccans must change every dealing with these teams from Egypt, Al -Hakar and Tunisia, as wellA volcano with all rudeness and deprivation of the team of a penalty kick with the collusion of the director and the mouse room."
"Diaz, if he wants to play essentially and develop from his level, he must with the Arsenal team in his place guaranteed there and even the way of offensive corresponding to Artita's philosophy and the Gunners will help a lot next year to try to achieve the Premier League ..
